## Introduction
The LifeWatch data explorer is an online application to browse, query, visualize and download data collected during the LifeWatch monthly sampling campaigns.

On this interface, biodiversity data on zooplankton groups are provided.

Zooplankton is sampled by vertical WP2 net tows, samples scanned with ZooScanner and identification with plankton analyser software, followed by manual validation.

A fixed dataset is available via: *“Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), Belgium (2019): LifeWatch observatory data: zooplankton observations in the Belgian Part of the North Sea. [https://doi.org/10.14284/394</a>](https://doi.org/10.14284/394</a>)."*

## How to cite this data
Users of this dataset agree to acknowledge LifeWatch.

The following acknowledgements is suggested: *“Zooplankton data were provided as part of the Flemish contribution to the LifeWatch ESFRI by Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ).”*
