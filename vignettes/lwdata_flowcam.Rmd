## Introduction
The LifeWatch data explorer is an online application to browse, query, visualize and download data collected during the LifeWatch monthly sampling campaigns.

On this interface, biodiversity data on microplankton groups are provided. A substantial part of the microplankton community consists of photosynthetic plankton or *phytoplankton*.

These organisms are the basis of the marine ecosystem, providing resources to the higher throphic levels. They also play an important role in many nutrient cycles and have a large impact on the atmosphere of our earth.

Microplankton is collected from the surface water and filtered through an apstein net with mesh size 50 &microm. Back in the lab these samples are processed with the FlowCam and identified with plankton image analysis software, followed by manual validation.
