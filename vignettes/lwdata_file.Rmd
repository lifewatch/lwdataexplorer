Combine data from all data types of the [LifeWatch Data Explorer](https://lifewatch.be/en/lifewatch-data-explorer)

In other modules, select the data of interest and download on to your download folder. Two files can then be uploaded and will merged based on the time field.

The files can also include data from other origin, but the field names must match.

File requirements:

- This system will accept comma or tab separated ASCII files (.csv or .txt).
- The first row should be the header with column names.
- Strings must in double quotes.
