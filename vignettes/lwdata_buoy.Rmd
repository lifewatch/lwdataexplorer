## Abstract
The Flanders Marine Institute within it’s remit and scope in RIs such as ICOS and Lifewatch, is operating 4 fixed point research and monitoring stations. Three of them are in the Oostende Spuikom and harbor and one is in the Thornton Bank. The stations have capacity for robust and frequent (e.g. 1 hr sync interval) near real time (NRT) transmission of data and are equipped with in situ sensors, for physical and biogeochemical parameters. Data from these stations are also available through the [ICOS Carbon Portal](https://data.icos-cp.eu/portal/#%7B%22route%22%3A%22metadata%22%2C%22id%22%3A%22n94jijAEWH95fMNn8Mwd4I0M%22%7D) and the [Spuikom monitoring website](https://www.vliz.be/spuikom/metingen) 
 
## How to cite these data

```{r get citation and license, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
library(jsonlite)

# Set base url 5251 4688
url <- "https://www.vliz.be/en/imis?module=dataset&dasid=5252"
dasid <- fromJSON(paste0(url, "&show=json"))

# Build citation. Get active DOI.
doi <- dasid[["dois"]]
doi <- subset(doi, doi$CurrentDOI == 1)$DOI
doi <- paste0("https://doi.org/", doi)
citation <- dasid[["datasetrec"]][["Citation"]]
citation <- paste0("> ", citation, " ", doi, 
                   ". Accessed through the LifeWatch Data Explorer / lwdataexplorer R package.")

# Get license
license <- dasid[["datasetrec"]][["AccConstrDisplay"]]

```{r display citation, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
cat(citation)
```

```{r display license, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
