## How to interpret this dataset
 
### Query options
* **Data Source**: One of: **Time bins**: Number of detections per tag and per station based on the selected sample period; **Residencies**: groups detections by period spent at each receiver and sampling frequency; or **Active network**: list of active deployments, in which case time = start of deployment.
* **Network**: The network of receiver or antenna deployments.
* **Project**: Animal project linked to the tag deployments.
* **Sample period**: Counts aggregated. One of 1 week, 1 day, 60 min, 10 min or 1 min.
* **Timeframe**: Starting and stopping date for the query.

### Available columns
* **Counts**: Total GPS fixes or detections.
* **Scientific_name**: The latin name of the species.
* **Project**: Project in charge of receiver deployments.
* **Network**: The network of receiver or antenna deployments.
* **Time**: Time in UTC, beginning of sample timeperiod.
* **Longitude**: Center longitude in decimal degrees, WGS84
* **Latitude**: Center latitude in decimal degrees, WGS84
* **Station**: Name or code of sampling station or receiver code.
* **Receiver**: Receiver name, composed of 'Model number'-'Serial number'.
* **Code**: Code of device on / in individual.
* **Moratorium**: Some data fields are masked, pending official data publication. eg Species name.
* **Duration**: Total time since receiver deployment (in hours).
* **Remaining**: Battery life remaining in the receiver (in hours). 
* **Expiry_date**: As in 'BATTERY_ESTIMATED_END_DATE' is the estimated date at which receiver will stop recording. This date is calculated automatically from (Deployments/Battery install date) and (Receivers/Expected battery life).
* **Location_name**: Name of receiver location. Please refer to a specific nearby point of land, town, island, or body of water that uniquely identifies this receiver location.
* **Residency**: Time in hours that an animal was present at a station.     
* **Absence**: Time in hours that an animal was not detected at a station (calculated between end of previous residence and start of current residence period).       
* **Species**: Scientific name of the animal, as in Gadus morhua.  
* **Endperiod**:  Last time that the animal was present at a station during the current residency period.

## Abstract

```{r abstract, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
# Get the abstract and/or description from IMIS and print here
library(jsonlite)

dasid <- fromJSON("https://www.vliz.be/en/imis?module=dataset&dasid=5912&show=json")

abstract <- dasid[["datasetrec"]][["EngAbstract"]]
description <- dasid[["datasetrec"]][["EngDescr"]]

if (is.null(abstract) & is.null(description)){

} else if(is.null(abstract) & !is.null(description)){
  out <- description
} else if(!is.null(abstract) & is.null(description)){

  out <- paste0(abstract, "</br></br>", description)
}

cat(out)
```

The ETN Data Explorer provides a set of  functions to access the aquatic animal tracking data and metadata linked to the European Tracking Network (ETN). As the access to data is linked to specific user profiles, keep in mind that the results can be different for other users and login is needed to access data under moratorium.

## How to cite these data

```{r get citation and license, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
library(jsonlite)

# Set base url
url <- "https://www.vliz.be/en/imis?module=dataset&dasid=5912"
dasid <- fromJSON(paste0(url, "&show=json"))

# Build citation. Get active DOI.
citation <- dasid[["datasetrec"]][["Citation"]]
citation <- paste0("> ", citation, " ", url, 
                   ". Accessed through the LifeWatch Data Explorer / lwdataexplorer R package.")

# Get license
license <- dasid[["datasetrec"]][["AccConstrDisplay"]]
```

```{r display citation, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
cat(citation)
```

```{r display license, results = 'asis', echo = FALSE}
cat(paste0("<b>Availability:</b>", license))
```
