## How to interpret this dataset
 
### Query options
* **Data Source**: One of: **Time bins**: groups detections by tag (code), receiver (station) and sampling frequency; **Residencies**: groups detections by period spent at each receiver and sampling frequency; or **Active network**: list of active deployments, in which case time = start of deployment.
* **Network**: The network of receiver or antenna deployments.
* **Project**: Animal project linked to the tag deployments.
* **Sample period**: Counts aggregated. One of 1 week, 1 day, 60 min, 10 min or 1 min.
* **Timeframe**: Starting and stopping date for the query.

### Available columns
* **Counts**: Total GPS fixes or detections
* **Scientific_name**: The latin name of the species
* **Project**: Project in charge of receiver deployments
* **Network**: The network of receiver or antenna deployments.
* **Time**: Time in UTC, beginning of sample timeperiod.
* **Longitude**: Center longitude in decimal degrees, WGS84
* **Latitude**: Center latitude in decimal degrees, WGS84
* **Station**: Name or code of sampling station or receiver code
* **Receiver**: Receiver name, composed of 'Model number'-'Serial number'.
* **Code**: Code of device on / in individual
* **Moratorium**: Some data fields are masked, pending official data publication. eg Species name 
* **Duration**:  
* **Remaining**:  
* **Expiry_date**:   
* **Location_name**: 
* **Residency**:      
* **Absence**:        
* **Species**:   
* **Endperiod**:

## Abstract

The etn data explorer provides a set of  functions to access the aquatic animal tracking data and metadata linked to the European Tracking Network (ETN). As the access to data is linked to specific user profiles, keep in mind that the results can be different for other users and login is needed to access data under moratorium.
