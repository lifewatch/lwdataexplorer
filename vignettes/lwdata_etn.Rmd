- Data from several INBO and Lifewatch acoustic fish telemetry projects on Belgian coast, Schelde, Maas and other rivers.
- Partners : INBO, Ugent, VLIZ, <br>Period : from 2011-01-01 on 
- Some project data is under moratorium, login to get full access
- Use query options to restrict data to several projects, tagging projects and tag codes.
- Data points are grouped according to selected sample period

#### Possible calculations
- *Time bins*: groups detections by tag (code) , receiver (station) and sampling frequency.
- *Residencies*: groups detections by period spent at each receiver and sampling frequency.
- *Active network*: list of active deployments, in which case time = start of deployment.
